# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) — Project 01: AdGuard Home

> **Coming soon.**

This folder will eventually include reproducible automation for the AdGuard Home case study:

- **ansible/** – systemd installation & configuration
- **terraform/** – Proxmox VM provisioning
- **compose/** – optional Docker Compose setup
- **scripts/** – helper scripts (verify, backup, restore)

For now, see the project documentation in `projects/01-adguard/docs/` for deployment, runbooks, security notes, and network reference.

**Status:** Placeholder only — no IaC code has been committed yet.
